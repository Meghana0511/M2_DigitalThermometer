COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR OUR PROJCT
LM35:
      
LM35 is a Precision temperature sensor IC with its output proportional to the temperature (in degree Celsius). LM35 is capable of giving accurate temperature readings compared to thermistor. The senor is sealed to avoid the effects of oxidation and other factors. It operates at a temperature range of -55°c to 150°c. The output voltage varies by 10mV in response to every °C rise or fall in atmospheric temperature.
